# fb-comment-sentiment-analysis
A repository for Facebook comment sentiment analysis using Transformers (BERT)

The task here is to sentiment analysis with facbook comments to classify each comment to either of the 3 classes: Appreciation, Complaint, and Feedback.

I tried solving the task using 2 different methods from Word2Vec embedding with lightgbm classification to the state-of-the-art transformer model (BERT) for word embedding together with a 3-layer feed-foward neaural network to perform classification.
